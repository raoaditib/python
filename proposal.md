# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

A Knight in the Woods 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

There is a knight traveling through the woods, at night, trying to get back to the castle. On his way, he encounters several enemies on his journey and must fight in combat with them. On his journey, the knight looks out for food or camp sites, where he is able to regain his energy and health, since every combat takes away from his health points. Ultimately, the knight's goal is to make it out of the woods alive. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This game will be similar to the format of a single-player board game, where there is one player rolling a die and getting a randomly generated number of steps each time. The player moves their character that many steps, and depending on what tile they land on, the player either enters combat with an enemy, receives a boon, or finds a campsite. To determine how many steps forward the knight moves during each turn, the program will give a randomly generated number. When in combat, the knight and the enemy can chose from three combat styles, which are melee, range, or magic (which will work simliar to rock, paper, scissors). When the knight successfully defeats the enemy, which is when the enemy's "health points" drop to 0, then the knight can continue on his journey. Otherwise, in the case that the knight is defeated, game over. The boons that are available to the knight include: a magic mushroom that gives you an extra life, and the apples that restore some of your health points. The camp sight allows the night to rest for the night, and stores his health points to full. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

If we can get the bare bones of the mechanics running, get the moving around the board and being able to trigger random events working. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Have all the mechanics working and have more visuals of both the map and the characters.  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Have all the mechanics working and have visuals for the map and visuals and names for all of the characters, and also get the combat aspect to work. Also, include a storyline and some dialogue. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our next step would be to iron out the details of our game, since we are just brainstorming and having cemented in any of the ideas yet. We are going to have to learn how to use Lua. We will need to reserach how to use Lua and make games using Lua. We will split up the different functions we will need to make throughout the game, and we will spend time collobrated together over Discord.
