Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We worked on different sections of our game individually, and did a progress check-in with each other. We made a few changes here and there. We have most of the written part of our game down. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We do not yet have any animations for our game. Also, we haven't put together our individual codes into a main. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We had some confusions at first, but we figured them out eventually.
